    <h1>ASGS 2016 Linked Data API</h1>
	<p>This is an API that delivers contents of the <a href="http://www.abs.gov.au/websitedbs/D3310114.nsf/home/Australian+Statistical+Geography+Standard+(ASGS)">Australian Statistical Geography Standard (ASGS) 2016 product</a> online as <a href="https://www.w3.org/standards/semanticweb/data">Linked Data</a>. To do this, the tool uses the <a href="http://linked.data.gov.au/def/asgs">ASGS Ontology</a> as its main data model and the series of public ASGS 2016 Web Feature Services, such as <a href="https://geo.abs.gov.au/arcgis/services/ASGS2016/MB/MapServer/WFSServer?service=wfs&version=2.0.0&request=GetCapabilities">the one for Mesh Blocks</a> as its source of data.</p>
	<p>This tool is currently still in beta testing mode and, while it is, it is operated by CSIRO's <a href="https://research.csiro.au/ei/">Environmental Informatics</a> team. In the medium term, the tool is likely to be managed by the <a href="http://www.abs.gov.au">Australian Bureau of Statistics</a>.</p>

        <h3>Non-ABS features in the ASGS will be implemented soon. Please be patient.</h3>
